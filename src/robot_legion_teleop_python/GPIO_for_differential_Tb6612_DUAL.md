# GPIO connections from Raspberry Pi 4 to DUAL Tb6612fng motor controllers to motors for a TANK TRACK DIFFERENTIAL DRIVE Chassis  

### **This version wires each SIDE as a paired set**:  
###   - LEFT FRONT and LEFT REAR receive the SAME PWM and direction signals  
###   - RIGHT FRONT and RIGHT REAR receive the SAME PWM and direction signals  
###   This prevents motors from fighting each other in a tank-style track system.

### TB6612 #1 - LEFT SIDE MOTORS (paired together)  

**Left Front Motor (Channel A)**  

**Motor wires**  

Motor + to A01  

Motor − to A02  

**Left Rear Motor (Channel B)**  

**Motor wires**  

Motor + to B01  

Motor − to B02  

**GPIO connections (tied so BOTH channels get identical commands)**  

PWMA **and** PWMB tied together → GPIO 12 (PWM)  

AIN1 **and** BIN1 tied together → GPIO 5  

AIN2 **and** BIN2 tied together → GPIO 6

### TB6612 #2 - RIGHT SIDE MOTORS (paired together)  

**Right Front Motor (Channel A)**  

**Motor wires**  

Motor + to A01  

Motor − to A02   

**Right Rear Motor (Channel B)**  

**Motor wires**  

Motor + to B01  

Motor − to B02  

**GPIO connections (tied so BOTH channels get identical commands)**  

PWMA **and** PWMB tied together → GPIO 18 (PWM)  

AIN1 **and** BIN1 tied together → GPIO 23  

AIN2 **and** BIN2 tied together → GPIO 24

### ADD BATTERIES TO POWER MOTORS  

### Common ground
**All grounds must connect together (critical)**:  

Pi GND to TB6612 GND (LEFT SIDE)

Pi GND to TB6612 GND (RIGHT SIDE)

#  
#   

### Motor power  

Battery + to VM on both boards (make a 3-sided jumper wire **OR** use a breadboard)  

Battery – to GND on both boards (make a 3-sided jumper wire **OR** use a breadboard)

### COMPLETE THE CIRCUIT

### To complete the circuit, connect STBY and VCC on BOTH MOTOR DRIVERS to the single 3.3V pin on the Raspberry Pi 

**Create a one-to-four jumper cable unless you are using a breadboard**  

**One way to do this is to make two three-ended jumper cables and connect one end of each to a third three-ended jumper cable.**  

**Then connect**:  

One end (the main stem) to the 3.3V pin on the Pi  

**Then connect the remaining four ends**:  

One end to VCC on motor MOTOR DRIVER 1  
One end to STBY on MOTOR DRIVER 1  
One end to VCC on MOTOR DRIVER 2  
One end to STBY on MOTOR DRIVER 2
