This is the minimal version of **AEmilioDistefano's ros2_ws repository**.

**Clone this repository** onto your robot's Raspberry Pi **rather than the ros2_ws repository**.

**You don't need virtualization on your Pi**, and **cloning the entire ros2_ws repository** (which includes virtualization) onto your Pi **will dramatically increase the time it takes to clone the ros2_ws repository onto your Pi**.
